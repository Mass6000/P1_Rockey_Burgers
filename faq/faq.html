            <h3>Why is your Rockey Burger So Expensive?</h3>
            <div class="reveal1">
                <p>We focus on making meals with the best and freshest ingredients, like humanely-raised beef that is
                    ground
                    fresh
                    each day, organic chicken, and Rockey Family Dairy’s organic cream for our ice cream cones, sundaes
                    and
                    shakes.
                </p>
                <p>Our commitment to freshness and quality means higher prices than you’d find at traditional fast-food
                    burger
                    chains. It also means food that tastes way better — because, well, it is.

            <h3>Where does your beef come from?</h3>
            <div class="reveal2">
                <p>We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local, family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to
                    15%
                    protein
                    to fat blend, a mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak for our
                    ground
                    beef.
                    The
                    mixture is ground daily, and thus, our burgers taste so amazing.
